import os
from collections import Counter
Here are some optimizations for the Python script:

1. Use list comprehension instead of a for loop to generate the `trending_topics` list in the `get_trending_topics` method:
```python
trending_topics = [trend["name"] for trend in trends[0]
                   ["trends"] if trend["name"].startswith("#")]
```

2. Use the `collections.Counter` class to count the number of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments in the `track_hashtag` method:
```python

sentiments = [self.analyze_sentiment(tweet.text) for tweet in tweets]
sentiment_counts = Counter(sentiments)

positive_count = sentiment_counts["positive"]
negative_count = sentiment_counts["negative"]
neutral_count = sentiment_counts["neutral"]
```

3. Use formatted strings(f-strings) instead of the `format` method for better readability in the sentiment analysis results:
```python
print(f"Positive: {positive_percent:.2f}%")
print(f"Negative: {negative_percent:.2f}%")
print(f"Neutral: {neutral_percent:.2f}%")
```

4. Move the generation of the user demographics report to a separate method and return the report as a string instead of printing it:
```python


def generate_user_demographics_report(self, user_demographics):
    report = "User Demographics:\n"

    for user_id, user_info in user_demographics.items():
        report += f"Username: {user_info['username']}\n"
        report += f"Followers: {user_info['followers']}\n"
        report += f"Location: {user_info['location']}\n"
        report += "\n"

    return report


```

5. Handle API credentials securely by using environment variables rather than hardcoding them in the code:

Replace these lines:
```python
consumer_key = "YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY"
consumer_secret = "YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET"
access_token = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
access_token_secret = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET"
```

With:
```python

consumer_key = os.environ.get("CONSUMER_KEY")
consumer_secret = os.environ.get("CONSUMER_SECRET")
access_token = os.environ.get("ACCESS_TOKEN")
access_token_secret = os.environ.get("ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET")

if any(v is None for v in [consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, access_token_secret]):
    raise ValueError("API credentials not provided.")
```

Remember to set the environment variables `CONSUMER_KEY`, `CONSUMER_SECRET`, `ACCESS_TOKEN`, and `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` with your actual API credentials.

These optimizations should improve the performance and readability of the script.
